## Description

The objective of this project was to create a blog site, where visitors can create accounts, write blog posts for all users to see, and add comments to any blog post. Users also have access to the Dashboard page, where they can edit or delete their previous blog posts.

A users login will be saved with a cookie for 1 day, before they will be required to log in again. If they are creating an account, they will be signed in automatically.

The blog I created is called Code Onion (A blog that is peeling back the tech world, one layer at a time). The site was deployed with Heroku and the link is included in the Usage section.
